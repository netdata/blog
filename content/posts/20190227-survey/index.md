Netdata is a community driven project. Your love, your enthusiasm, your needs define its roadmap. We always did it that way. This is how netdata got health monitoring, streaming, data archiving to third party time-series databases, etc.

With this survey, we try to understand the kind of infrastructure you monitor with netdata, how you integrate it with other systems, what is important for you to have improved in netdata, etc.

You will spend just 2 minutes with it. [Help us shape the future of netdata now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lXKZd8YOKJxF1clQHkv8N1tx2rF4PqPjhRwLYDceA3g/edit).
