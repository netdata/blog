Enough with Internet of Things (IoT) deployments with edge devices that can't take care of themselves. IT teams have better things to do than try to wrap their heads around sending huge volumes of data from thousands of remote devices, analyzing that information in a central location, and hoping to respond fast enough during anomalies or outages.

Edge monitoring promises to change that less-than-real-time

## Understanding the complexity of edge monitoring






There's no more room in complex Internet of Things (IoT) deployments for edge devices that can't take care of themselves. These networks of devices, often in far-flung, hostile locations, need to be able to monitor their own health and performance, analyze it in real-time *on the device itself*, and react accordingly.





By loading up edge devices with high-level health and performance monitoring, IT teams empower themselves with the ability to create self-healing infrastructures. A sensor goes starts showing anomalous behavior in a remote location? There might 



There is no question that Internet of Things (IoT) deployments are becoming extraordinarily complex. And while the devices in these far-flung, often hostile locations—often referred to as the **edge** of the network—used to
