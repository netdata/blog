**`systemd` journals** play a crucial role in the Linux system ecosystem, and understanding the importance of the logs contained within is essential for both system administrators and developers.
<!--truncate-->
For those unfamiliar, `systemd` is an init system employed by Linux distributions, initiates the user space and oversees all ensuing processes. One of its key components, `systemd` journal, assumes a central role in logging system activities and messages, delivering a host of benefits to both system administrators, developers and cyber security engineers. The `systemd` journal functions as a logging system that gathers, archives, and oversees log messages and event data originating from a diverse array of system components, encompassing the kernel, system services, applications, and user activities.

# Why is it a must use tool for your infrastructure monitoring?

Given the rich and structured information `systemd` journals provide, they are an essential tool for anyone responsible for maintaining, monitoring, or developing applications and services for Linux systems. Properly managed and analyzed, they can offer deep insights into system health, performance, and security.

Here are the primary reasons why these **logs are so important**, from a security perspective:  

-   **Audit Trail**  
    `systemd` journals provide an audit trail, recording user actions, system and applications events, and related activities. This is invaluable for tracking unauthorized or unexpected changes and actions.  
      
-   **Intrusion Detection**  
    Any unauthorized or malicious activity, like multiple failed login attempts or unexpected service activations, can be identified by monitoring `systemd` logs.     
    
-   **Forensics**  
    In the event of a system breach or failure, `systemd` logs are the most crucial part of the forensic process, helping to recreate the sequence of events leading up to the incident.  
    
-   **Immutable Logs**  
    `systemd` journals ensure that once a log entry is made, it's unchangeable. This safeguards the authenticity of historical records. Even in the event of a system breach, attackers cannot modify existing logs, ensuring a reliable record for security assessments.  
      
-   **Structured Logs**  
    Unlike traditional log files which are unstructured, `systemd` journals store entries in a structured binary format. This ensures logs are uniformly organized with explicit fields, simplifying parsing and analysis, and ensuring data consistency across entries.  

-   **Compliance**  
    For organizations that need to adhere to certain regulatory standards (e.g., HIPAA, SOX, GDPR), `systemd` logs provide evidence of compliance by maintaining a record of system and user activity.  
      
-   **Accountability**  
    `systemd` journal logs can be used to ensure that operational standards are being followed, especially in environments with multiple administrators or users.
    
On the operational side, when something goes wrong—be it a service crash or system malfunction—the first place most administrators look is the logs. **[`systemd` journals](https://blog.netdata.cloud/exploring-systemd-journal-logs-with-netdata/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=internallinking&utm_campaign=systemd-security)** provide detailed logs that can help diagnose the root cause of issues, identify usage patterns in recurring issues, and highlight service dependencies.

Continuous monitoring of `systemd` journals can help administrators spot potential issues before they become critical. This includes identifying deprecated configurations, services nearing resource limits, or suspicious activities.

Application developers can also benefit from `systemd` journal logs when debugging application issues in a live environment. These logs can provide context about the system state and other running services that might influence application behavior.

## Centralized Logs Management

In a multi-server or distributed system environment, the complexity of log management increases exponentially. Each server or service may generate its own set of logs, and keeping track of all these disparate logs can be challenging. This is where centralized logging becomes pivotal.

By consolidating logs from various servers into one place, administrators gain a holistic view of the entire infrastructure. This facilitates efficient cross-referencing of events, eases the determination of root causes, and streamlines monitoring and alerting.

Centralizing `systemd` journal logs ensures a unified, secure, and integrated approach to log management:

-   **Unified Infrastructure wide view**  
Gathering logs from multiple sources and systems into a single, unified dashboard, makes monitoring and analysis significantly easier.  
      
-   **Real-time Threat Detection**  
Monitoring logs for suspicious activities, multiple failed login attempts, unusual data transfers, etc., providing the ability to detect potential security threats in real-time.  
    
-   **Data Integrity**  
    Moving logs to a central place in real-time, can ensure that logs are available and not tampered. `systemd` journals offer cryptographic signing or hashing of logs to guarantee their integrity.  
      
-   **Compliance Adherence**  
    Many regulations require organizations to maintain logs for specific durations and ensure that they are tamper-proof. `systemd` journal can help meet these requirements.  
     
-   **Retention & Archival**  
    A centralized logs management system provides control over how long logs are retained and ensures older logs are archived for future reference or compliance needs.

A logs management system isn't just a repository for raw data; it's a powerful tool that can offer invaluable insights into operations and security.

### `systemd` journal is the right tool for security

![`systemd`](https://github.com/netdata/blog/assets/139226121/9e26d151-dc14-4d6c-a36a-0e6f4518fa1e)


`systemd` journals are designed to be an integrated and robust logging solution for modern Linux systems and they offer some important security features that aim to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of logs:

### Log Sealing

When `systemd` journals are configured to use log sealing, cryptographic techniques are employed to sign the journal files. Here's why that's important:

-   **Integrity**  
    By sealing the journal files, any tampering or modification of the log data can be detected. If someone tries to alter a log entry, the signature verification will fail.  

-   **Authenticity**  
    It ensures that the logs were genuinely written by the system and not injected or fabricated by an attacker. The signature can serve as a proof of the origin of the logs.
    
#### Forward-Secure Sealing (FSS)

Forward-secure sealing takes log sealing a step further. The idea behind FSS is that even if an attacker manages to compromise the current cryptographic key, they should not be able to retroactively tamper with past logs without detection.

-   **How it works**  
    Forward-secure sealing uses a cryptographic technique that involves evolving the cryptographic keys over time. After a set interval, `journald` will "forget" the old key and generate a new one. Even if the latest key is compromised, it can't be used to alter or fake signatures from earlier intervals because those old keys are no longer available.
    
-   **Security against key compromise**  
    This ensures that even if a system's security is breached and the current key is exposed, attackers cannot use that key to alter past logs in a way that makes them appear legitimate. Only logs signed after the breach could be tampered with, but logs prior to that remain secure.

Of course, cryptographically sealing logs can add some overhead. Depending on the scale and volume of logs, and the system's performance, this overhead might be negligible or significant.

Furthermore,  `journald` rate-limits the messages it receives. This can prevent log flooding, which can be used as a form of DoS attack or to bury meaningful log entries in noise.

`systemd` journals use LZ4 compression for all journal files. This not only saves disk space but also provides a form of lightweight obfuscation. Though compression is not encryption, it does make plain text log scraping harder for someone who might gain unauthorized access to the journal files.

Unlike traditional log files which are predominantly text, `journald` logs are stored in a binary, structured format. This means that logs contain explicit fields (like `_UID`, `_PID`, etc.), making them not only more consistent but also more resistant to log injection attacks where malicious actors might try to insert fake log entries.

And as expected from a modern logs management `systemd`, systemd  `journald` handles automatic rotation of journal files and can enforce policies regarding how much log data is retained. This can be specified in terms of storage space used or time. Automatically discarding old logs can help ensure that sensitive data does not linger on systems indefinitely.

And in cases, this is required, users can specify where journal logs should be stored: in volatile memory (e.g., /run/log/journal/), on disk (/var/log/journal/), or both. Storing logs in volatile memory means they are automatically wiped on system reboot, which can be a feature for systems where persisting logs might be a security concern.

In summary, `systemd` journal incorporates multiple features designed to enhance the security posture of log data. When used correctly, and in combination with other system security practices, it provides a reliable and secure logging solution.
