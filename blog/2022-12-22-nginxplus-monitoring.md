As a continuation of our series for monitoring web servers with [NGINX](https://blog.netdata.cloud/nginx-monitoring/) and [APACHE](https://blog.netdata.cloud/apache-monitoring/), let us find out how to effectively and easily monitor and troubleshoot NGINXPlus using Netdata!

## What is NGINXPlus

NGINXPLus is an open source web server and load balancer. It is an enterprise-grade version of the popular open source NGINX web server, with additional features for scalability, performance, and monitoring. NGINXPLus includes features such as load balancing, content caching, and HTTP/2 support, and is suitable for applications of any size. NGINXPLus is highly customizable and can be used to deploy web applications in a variety of environments.

## Monitoring NGINXPlus with Netdata

The prerequisites for monitoring NGINXPlus with Netdata are to have NGINXPlus and [Netdata installed](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/get-started) on your system. 

Netdata auto discovers hundreds of services, and for those it doesn't, turning on manual discovery is a one line configuration. For more information on configuring Netdata for NGINXPlus monitoring please read the collector [documentation](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/go.d.plugin/modules/nginxplus).

You should now see the NGINXPlus section on the Overview tab in Netdata Cloud already populated with charts about all the metrics you care about.

Netdata has a public [demo space](https://app.netdata.cloud/spaces/netdata-demo) (no login required) where you can explore different monitoring use-cases and get a feel for Netdata.

## What NGINXPlus metrics are important to monitor?


The metrics that Netdata collects are organized into subsections within the nginxplus section for easier navigation. Each metric is represented by a composite chart that aggregates the data across multiple nodes/instances etc.

Below, you can find a brief description of the NGINXPlus metrics being collected and visualised on Netdata:

### client_connections_rate
 - Accepted and dropped (not handled) connections. A connection is considered <b>dropped</b> if the worker process is unable to get a connection for the request by establishing a new connection or reusing an open one.

## Troubleshooting NGINXPlus with Netdata

### Alerts
Netdata has built-in alerts to reduce the monitoring burden for you. 

If you would like to update the alert thresholds for any of these alerts or want to create your own alert for another metric – please follow the [instructions here](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/monitor/configure-alarms).

By default you will receive email notifications whenever an alert is triggered – if you would not like to receive these notifications you can turn them off from your profile settings.

### Anomaly Advisor
Anomaly Advisor lets you quickly identify if the system you are monitoring has any anomalies and allows you to drill down into which metrics are behaving anomalously.

To learn more about how to use Anomaly Advisor to troubleshoot your Apache web server check out the [documentation](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/insights/anomaly-advisor) or visit the [anomalies tab](https://app.netdata.cloud/spaces/netdata-demo/rooms/apache/anomalies) in the demo space to play with it right now.

### Metric Correlations 
[Metric Correlations](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/insights/metric-correlations) lets you quickly find metrics and charts related to a particular window of interest that you want to explore further. By displaying the standard Netdata dashboard, filtered to show only charts that are relevant to the window of interest, you can get to the root cause sooner.
