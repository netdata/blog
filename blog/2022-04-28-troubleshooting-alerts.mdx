At Netdata, we love two things more than anything else: 
<ol>
 	<li> Troubleshooting and,</li>
 	<li> Making things easier for you! </li>
</ol>
Our goal is to make troubleshooting and monitoring as seamless as possible with the open-source Agent. This includes giving you pre-configured alerts so that you get notified immediately when a disruption occurs.

The Netdata Agent comes with over 250 pre-configured and optimized alerts. But we want you to be the master of your infrastructure monitoring by:
<ul>
 	<li>understanding what each an every alert in your system is about</li>
 	<li>providing the possibility of easily customizing your alert configurations based on your needs.</li>
</ul>
It’s hard to make it easy to use 250 alerts without requiring high knowledge retention and memorization, but we’re committed to solving this for you.

That’s why, here at Netdata, we have been baking up something new for you over the past few months. In our community forum, you can now find <a href="https://community.netdata.cloud/c/alerts/28">an Alerts Troubleshooting space</a>. This forum is one of the many collaborative tools that we utilize to empower teams to easily make troubleshooting decisions by using the power of the expertise of our  community and their diverse skill sets.

## Why participate in our troubleshooting space?

This space is open for everyone, an asynchronous but living conversation space where we can keep a helpful record of successful troubleshooting steps and information! From veteran sysadmins to DevOps engineers to those just getting started with infrastructure monitoring. In this space, you can find information about all the Netdata Agent out-of-the-box alerts, the components related to them, and possible troubleshooting actions you can take to solve the root cause which triggered this alert.

## How can I access this space?

## For the hardcore Netdata Developers

What about a custom alert? Most of the Netdata faithful love to hack the Agent and create their custom alerts. In that case, you will not find your alert in our troubleshooting space. But that’s ok, you can always contact our Agent team (share your idea with the community in our <a href="https://github.com/netdata/netdata/discussions/categories/ideas">Github Discussion</a> and make your contribution available <a href="https://github.com/netdata/netdata">upstream</a>.
