Hey Netdata community,

We have some exciting news for you: weâ€™re launching our new and updated [Windows collectors](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/data-collection/monitor-anything/System%20Metrics/Windows-machines) with the goal of making the [Windows monitoring experience](https://www.netdata.cloud/windows-monitoring/) as seamless as possible ðŸŽ‰

As you may know, we do not support a native Windows installation for Netdata agent, but we still wanted to make the monitoring experience as seamless as possible and ensure that Windows servers and applications are first-class citizens in the Netdata monitoring universe.
Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve leveraged windows_exporter, a well-known exporter supported by the Prometheus community, and Netdataâ€™s Windows collector to provide you with meaningful charts on your systemsâ€™ health metrics, including CPU, memory, disk utilization, network traffic, and more.

But thatâ€™s not all. Netdata also collects metrics from your packaged Windows applications such as [Active Directory](https://www.netdata.cloud/ad-monitoring/), [SQL Server](https://www.netdata.cloud/mssql-monitoring/), [Exchange Server](https://www.netdata.cloud/msexchange-monitoring/), [IIS](https://www.netdata.cloud/iis-monitoring/) and [.NET Framework](https://www.netdata.cloud/dotnet-monitoring/). 

Do check out our article on [how to effectively monitor Windows servers with Netdata](https://www.netdata.cloud/windows-monitoring/). It will help you easily set up Netdata to monitor your Windows server and applications and get insights into the performance and availability of your critical services.
