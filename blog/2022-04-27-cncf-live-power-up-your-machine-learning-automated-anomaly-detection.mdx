## Join Us Live to Talk ML

Join ML Lead Andrew Maguire and Product Manager Shyam Sreevalsan on the 23rd of June at 5pm UTC for the Netdata Machine Learning Meetup, which will be livestreamed on Youtube. In this session, we will demo and preview new and future features, along with a Q&amp;A, and discuss the following topics:
<ul>
 	<li>The role of Machine Learning in DevOps Infrastructure Monitoring &amp; Troubleshooting</li>
 	<li>The Netdata way of approaching Machine Learning</li>
 	<li>Challenges of building Macvhine learning solutions that are useful and user friendly.</li>
</ul>
Feel free to ask questions or share ideas on <a href="https://discord.gg/ZyeDHQTdaW">our Community Discord</a>, or <a href="https://(https://www.meetup.com/netdata-infrastructure-monitoring-meetup-group/events/286243158/">RSVP to the event</a>. We look forward to seeing you then!

## CNCF Live: Power up your machine learning - Automated anomaly detection

Our Analytics &amp; ML lead Andrew Maguire recently had a chance to share our new <a href="https://community.netdata.cloud/t/anomaly-advisor-beta-launch/2717">Anomaly Advisor</a> feature with the wider CNCF community. In his demonstration he did some light chaos engineering (using <a href="https://www.gremlin.com/">Gremlin</a> and <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/stress-ng">stress-ng</a>) to generate some real anomalies on his infrastructure and watch how it all played out in the Anomaly Advisor in Netdata Cloud.

There were also some great questions and discussion from the audience around ML in general and in the observability space itself.

Check it out for yourself on the CNCF channel on <a href="https://youtu.be/pI-MUupmD64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n8ZAlD0n1_clryezT_L7MhLvyR6wPgfQRyGwZWC_LTc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>).
