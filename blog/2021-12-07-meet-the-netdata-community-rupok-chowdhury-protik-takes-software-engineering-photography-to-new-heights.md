In our ongoing Meet the community series, we focus on global Netdata community members. In this installment, learn about Software Engineer and photographer Rupok Chowdhury Protik, including how they use Netdata.



<strong>Introduce yourself, what you do, and your current job role.</strong>



Hi, I’m Rupok Chowdhury Protik. I’m a PHP Developer with a Master’s degree in Software Engineering. My stack is mainly LAMP/LEMP. I used to work as the Senior Web Application Developer in a multinational company and then later joined Incsub LLC, a WordPress-focused company with people from more than 50 countries. I am currently working in Incsub LLC as a DevOps Support Engineer.



I have been an official organizer of the WordPress Meetup Dhaka Chapter since 2013, and I was one of the organizers of the WordCamp Dhaka International Conference. I am an international speaker. I had my sessions in different conferences, including local and international conferences. I’m also a WordPress Translation Editor for the Bengali language and WordPress Translation Contributor.



<strong>How are you using Netdata and what do you like so far?</strong>



I came to know about Netdata quite a while ago. I used to use it on my personal and client servers. Currently, at our office, we extensively use Netdata for server analytics and metrics. The part I like most about Netdata is the extremely beautiful visualization capabilities of server statistics. Visualizing a big chunk of critical data is a challenging task, and I personally think, Netdata nailed it. Apart from that, it’s very easy to set up, it has great documentation, a solid codebase, and it’s beginner-friendly. These are the things I like most about Netdata.



<strong>What would you like to see us offer next at Netdata?</strong>



So far, the latest Netdata release covers all my needs at this point. However, I’ll surely communicate if I find a missing feature that could be helpful for me and others.



<strong>What are some fun hobbies that you have?</strong>



I have quite a few hobbies. I’m a musician, I had my music band, and we used to do symphonic gothic metal. In addition, whenever I get little time, I play my piano.



I am also a photographer.<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rupokify/9253709699/">The following photographs are one of my most favorite shots</a>.



I also read books, sing songs, and I love to travel a lot. I’ve already visited 18 countries. Hopefully, the pandemic will be completely over soon, and I will be able to visit many more beautiful countries.
