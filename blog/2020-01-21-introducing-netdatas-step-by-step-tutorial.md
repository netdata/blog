Health monitoring and performance troubleshooting aren’t easy. That’s exactly <em>why</em> we’re building Netdata, to democratize monitoring and make it accessible to anyone interested in learning more about their systems and applications.

Of course, teaching a complicated topic isn’t easy either.

Until recently, the only resource to help new users after installation has been our <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/getting-started/">getting started guide</a>. While that’s useful for those who have monitoring experience and a background in Linux administration, it jumps wildly over the heads of many Netdata users.

To fill that knowledge gap, we recently released an extensive <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/step-by-step/step-00/">step-by-step tutorial for Netdata</a>, which guides you through everything you need to know about the best single node monitoring solution out there.

<em><strong>If you’re new to monitoring, or just new to Netdata, we wrote this tutorial for you.</strong></em>

Each of the ten steps covers some fundamental component of the Netdata experience:
<ul>
 	<li>Step 1. Netdata’s building blocks</li>
 	<li>Step 2. Get to know Netdata’s dashboard</li>
 	<li>Step 3. Monitor more than one system with Netdata</li>
 	<li>Step 4. The basics of configuring Netdata</li>
 	<li>Step 5. Health monitoring alarms and notifications</li>
 	<li>Step 6. Collect metrics from more services and apps</li>
 	<li>Step 7. Netdata’s dashboard in depth</li>
 	<li>Step 8. Building your first custom dashboard</li>
 	<li>Step 9. Long-term metrics storage</li>
 	<li>Step 10. Set up a proxy</li>
</ul>
Yes, this tutorial has a lot of material, but given all of the capabilities the Netdata team has diligently built, it’s actually just the beginning. We’re excited to see our community dig in and <a href="https://github.com/netdata/netdata/issues">let us know</a> how we could make it even better.

<h2>What’s next?</h2>
&nbsp;

As with every step within the <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/step-by-step/step-00/">tutorial</a> itself, this post also ends with a <strong>What’s next?</strong> section.

We’re working on comprehensive, valuable educational content directed toward the very people Costa, our CEO, addressed in his manifesto: “The people who find it hard to properly monitor their infrastructure.” Of course, we’ll always have detailed information for the experienced sysadmins, but we’re committed to teaching <em>anyone</em> who is interested in real-time health monitoring and performance troubleshooting.
