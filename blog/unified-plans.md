<!--truncate-->

As the landscape of real-time monitoring evolves, so does the diversity and complexity of use cases that our community brings to Netdata. Our mission has always been to democratize monitoring by making it accessible, powerful, and scalable for everyone. With the rapid growth of our user base and their expanding needs, it's become clear that our plan structure must evolve to maintain this mission sustainably.

# A Unified Plan Structure

We are launching a new unified plan structure, that will come into effect on March 13th, 2024. This evolution from our previous offerings, including Early Bird and Unlimited Community Plans, is designed to cater more effectively to the diverse needs of our community. The new structure comprises four tailored plans:

- **Netdata Enterprise:** For large-scale professional and organizational use, offering comprehensive monitoring fully on-premise.
- **Netdata Business:** Designed for businesses seeking robust monitoring with advanced features.
- **Netdata Homelab:** Tailored for enthusiasts monitoring personal projects in a homelab environment.
- **Netdata Community:** Our commitment to accessibility continues with this plan, intended as a playground to experience Netdata and for users with very basic monitoring needs.

# What is Changing?

The Unified Plan Structure introduces a fair usage policy applicable to all spaces (accounts), ensuring a balanced approach to usage based on intent and the number of monitored nodes and will have the following impact to existing plans:

- The `Early Bird` and `Unlimited Community` Plans will be discountinued on 13-03-2024.
- The `Business` and `Homelab` Plans will remain the same with no impact to users.
- The `Community (2023.11)` Plan remains the same with no impact to users.

# What does this mean for existing users?

The changes only impact users on `Early Bird` and Old Unlimited `Community (2023.02)` plans.

This transition marks a shift towards a structured offering that aligns with your monitoring needs and usage patterns. Here's what the transition entails:

- **60-Day Free Trial of Netdata Business:** Automatically granted to users currently on Early Bird and Unlimited Community Plans, offering a seamless experience to explore Business Plan features.
- **Choosing Your Next Plan:** After the trial, select from the Enterprise, Business, Homelab, or Community Plans based on your specific needs and usage.

# Addressing Your Concerns

**Why the Change?**  
Adapting our plan structure enables us to streamline operations, ensure fair resource allocation, and focus on sustainable growth. It's a step forward in our commitment to providing a high-quality, scalable solution for real-time monitoring.

**Ensuring a Smooth Transition**  
We understand that changes like these come with questions and potential concerns. Our goal is to make this transition as smooth as possible:

- **No Immediate Action Required:** Enjoy the full benefits of the Business Plan during the trial without any disruption to your service.
- **Informed Decision Making:** We'll provide detailed information to help you choose the best plan for your needs after the trial period.
- **Special Offer for Our Early Supporters:** Recognizing the invaluable role of our early adopters, we're offering a 25% lifetime discount on the Business Plan for users transitioning from the Early Bird and Unlimited Community Plans.

A: We're simplifying our plan offerings to streamline operations, ensure fair resource usage, and support sustainable growth. This change will help us deliver a more efficient and agile service to our community.

**Q: What are the new plans available?**  
A: Starting March 13th, 2024, we'll offer four plans: Netdata Enterprise, Netdata Business, Netdata Homelab, and Netdata Community. Each is designed to meet the specific needs of different user segments, from large organizations to personal, non-professional use.

**Q: What will happen to my current Early Bird or Unlimited Community Plan?**
