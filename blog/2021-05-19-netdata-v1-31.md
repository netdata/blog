Give a warm welcome to Netdata v1.31.0, which features:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Re-packaged and redesigned dashboard</strong>: A more informational and feature-rich “frame” for your monitoring and troubleshooting sessions.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>eBPF expands into the directory cache</strong>: Monitor whether your services or applications are properly using Linux’s memory management for the best performance and minimal disk I/O.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Machine learning-powered collectors</strong>: Detect anomalies using only your own data and minimal resource utilization on your monitored nodes.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>An improved Netdata learning experience</strong>: A timeline of new content, refreshed visuals, and a newly-open sourced repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_1876248811621353710666">Re-packaged and redesigned dashboard</h2>
We re-packaged and redesigned portions of the dashboard to improve the overall experience. Part of this effort is better handling of dashboard code during installation—anyone using third-party packages (such as the Netdata Homebrew formula) will start seeing new features and the new designs starting today.

For those who aren’t using third-party packages (thank you!), your installation process will still get a little bit faster.

<div class="et_pb_text_inner">

A change we’ve made to help with this is moving the <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/dashboard/select-timeframes">timeframe picker</a> to the top bar to make it easier to find, while also providing more viewing space for your dashboards.

Just to the right of the picker is the new alert status section, which uses two counters to show live counts of <code>CRITICAL</code> and <code>WARNING</code> alerts on your node. Click either of them to open the alerts modal.

In-product documentation and settings have been moved to the left sidebar to differentiate between how you <i>configure</i> Netdata and how you <i>actively use</i> Netdata.

Even more dashboard improvements are coming, so stay tuned.

<h2>eBPF expands into the directory cache</h2>
We’re continuing to delve deep into helping you monitor exactly how your services and applications are interacting with the Linux kernel and deliver insights that you can’t get from other monitoring solutions.

Our latest advancement is in monitoring the directory cache (d-cache), which holds a portion of your filesystem in memory to speed up the way applications look up and access files. This new eBPF program watches Linux kernel activity to to identify when services or applications are looking for files that don’t exist in the directory cache or are not found entirely.

By monitoring the directory cache, developers and SREs alike can easily find opportunities to optimize memory usage and reduce disk-intensive operations.

If you’ve had Netdata installed on your node for a while, you might need to manually enable the new directory cache collector. Connect to your node with SSH and navigate to the Netdata config directory, which is usually /etc/netdata. Then open <code>ebpf.d.conf</code> for editing:
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash">
<span class="token function">sudo</span> ./edit-config ebpf.d.conf
</code></pre>
Check to see if the <code>dcstat</code> setting is set to <code>yes</code>. If not, make that change and save the file. While you’re here, you might as well enable <code>cachestat</code>, which was released in v1.30.0, if it’s not already.
<pre class=" language-conf"><code class=" language-conf">[ebpf programs]
    cachestat = yes
    dcstat = yes
    ...
</code></pre>
Restart Netdata with <code>sudo systemctl restart netdata</code> and refresh the dashboard to launch the new directory cache collector. You’ll find these charts in the <strong>Applications</strong> section, under the submenu <strong>directory cache (eBPF)</strong>.

<h2>Machine learning-powered collectors</h2>
While we already have <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/cloud/insights/metric-correlations">Metric Correlations</a> for Netdata Cloud users, we’re constantly exploring new ways to bring machine learning-based anomaly detection features to individual, distributed nodes running our <a href="https://github.com/netdata/netdata">open-source monitoring agent</a>. This would give you the flexibility to detect anomalies anywhere, even on systems that are “air-gapped” from the rest of the internet.

Our new <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin/zscores">Z-scores</a> and <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/python.d.plugin/changefinder">changefinder</a> collectors offer two new ways to perform on-device machine learning.

Z-scores visualize which metrics are deviating from their mean, and by how many standard deviations. It’s a simple calculation, but when performed every 5 seconds, using your own real-world metrics, it’s a phenomenally easy way to get instant feedback when essential services/applications are running amok.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16406" src="/img/wp-archive/uploads/2021/05/ebpf_directory-cache-3-600x338.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" />

The changefinder collector returns a changepoint score for every chart or dimension you configure it to monitor, and it evolves over time as new metrics roll in. Because there’s no batch training, this type of machine learning is scalable—ideal for situations where you need to monitor lots of charts, or have many child nodes all streaming their metrics to a single parent to do all the heavy ML lifting.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16408" src="/img/wp-archive/uploads/2021/05/zscores-4-600x205.png" alt="" width="600" height="205" />

Keep in mind that as with all things ML, these collectors are a bit of an experiment. Take care if you’re using them in production environments and drop a note on the <a href="https://community.netdata.cloud/">community forum</a> or at <a href="mailto:analytics-ml-team@netdata.cloud">analytics-ml-team@netdata.cloud</a> with any and all feedback, both positive and negative. Your feedback is priceless when it comes to helping us make complex features more useful.
<h2>An improved Netdata learning experience</h2>
While not technically a part of the latest release of the open-source Netdata monitoring agent, we’re proud to have released a refreshed version of our documentation and educational site, <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/">Netdata Learn</a>, just last week.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16411" src="/img/wp-archive/uploads/2021/05/changefinder-5-600x196.png" alt="" width="600" height="196" />

The homepage now features a timeline of the latest new collectors, guides, and educational content that we’ve released. There’s refreshed visuals throughout, faster paths to various documentation, and a clearer distinction between the open-source Netdata monitoring agent and Netdata Cloud.

While there’s always been search functionality built into Netdata Learn, we’ve made it a bit more obvious and added a more obvious keyboard shortcut. Hit <code>Ctrl/⌘ + k</code> to start a new search!

We also made the <a href="https://github.com/netdata/learn">repository for this website</a> public for the first time. Feel free to poke around, see how the sausage is made, or even suggest improvements via the issues or PRs. We’re excited to bring the community into the fold on how we manage and deploy our documentation! There’s plenty more features coming soon, and we’ll keep you apprised of them as they’re pushed into production.

<h2>Install or update Netdata</h2>
If you don’t yet have Netdata, which is always free and open source, you can <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/get">get started</a> with a single command on most Linux systems:

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-16413" src="/img/wp-archive/uploads/2021/05/learn_screenshot-6-600x338.png" alt="" width="600" height="338" />
<pre class=" language-bash"><code class=" language-bash"><span class="token function">bash</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh<span class="token punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
The same command works if you want to update Netdata, and you installed it this way in the first place. If you followed a different method, check out our <a href="https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/packaging/installer/update#determine-which-installation-method-you-used">update</a> doc for details.

To expand from monitoring a single node with Netdata to an infrastructure of distributed nodes, check out <a href="https://app.netdata.cloud/sign-up?cloudRoute=/spaces">Netdata Cloud</a>, which brings metrics from many nodes into a unified view with real-time, on-demand streaming.
