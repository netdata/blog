<h2>Showing our appreciation</h2>
Without IT, most businesses wouldn’t exist, and without sysadmins, there wouldn’t be IT! This is why we are elated to celebrate Sysadmin Day with you. <a title="System Administrator Appreciation Day" href="https://sysadminday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">System Administrator Appreciation Day</a> is an annual, day-long celebration dedicated to those who not only keep our systems up and running, but businesses as well. It’s an opportunity for us to pay tribute to those who work long hours, putting out fires and preventing problems before they happen. This year, Sysadmin Day falls on Friday, July 31, and we’ll be celebrating all week long.
<h2>What exactly is a sysadmin?</h2>
A <a title="system administrator" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system administrator</a> or sysadmin, is responsible for a wide range of tasks including maintaining reliable system operations and upkeep of performance and security. Their efforts are critical for business continuity. As a company that exists to help IT pros monitor and troubleshoot systems, applications, and infrastructure, we at Netdata know first-hand how important this role is.
<h2>How we’re celebrating: showing off homelabs and battlestations</h2>
Our week-long celebration will feature Netdata employees’ homelabs and battlestations to give you a view into how our global team works. We’d love for you to share a glimpse of your systems running Netdata, your homelab, or your battlestation. Our IT Heroes and Homelabs theme is designed to inspire each other, as more of us start to work from home and begin to depend on remote operations. As a fully remote, tech-first company, naturally, we’re excited to share Netdata staffers’ home workstations. Here’s a sneak peek of a few:

<h6>A homelab from James Mill, senior SRE at Netdata, featuring his “Rack Cabinet” / “Server Room.” From James, “This is a 22 RU 19″ Rack Cabinet with 3x Supermicro 1RU servers with single socket Intel Xeon 3.4Ghz 32GB DDR4 RAM and 2x Samsung EVO 560(s) ea. These all run Proxmox VE Hypervisor and dozens of VMs that make up my Home infrastructure. The larger server is a 4RU Supermicro with 10 3.5″ Drive bays and 4 2.5″ bays. The 3.5″ bays are fully populated for a ZFS RAID-Z2 storage array of ~22TB. At the top if a fully managed 24-port Gbpg switch where (yes) most of the cables that run into the wall are actually used throughout my home.”</h6>

<h6>This image features an upgraded laptop by Markos Fountoulakis, senior software engineer at Netdata. In his words, “This is my laptop, naked. Top left would be the DVD-WR device, bottom left would be the HDD, they’re both missing in this picture, so what I did was upgrade my laptop, almost completely. I upgraded my HDD (should be bottom left) to a 2TB drive, I upgraded my other disk drive (bottom right) to a 512GB NVMe SSD drive, those are very fast, so the fast drive is the boot drive, the slow one is for archival storage (lots of data). I upgraded my main memory (2 RAM stick bottom-center) to 32GB of RAM and I also upgraded my WiFi card (top-center-left) to a fast 5GHz one. Typically, people don’t upgrade their laptops, because it’s either too troublesome or impossible because the components are soldered on the mainboard, so that’s my desktop-like laptop.”</h6>

<h6>Nicolás Parada, backend developer, has a setup that includes a Lenovo S940 running Windows (monitoring Docker with Netdata), a piano “collecting dust until the day I decide to play it,” an electrical standing desk, and is elevating his lighting game with some RGB lights and an Xiaomi lamp.</h6>
