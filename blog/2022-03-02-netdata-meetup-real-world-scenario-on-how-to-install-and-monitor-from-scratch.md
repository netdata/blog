Announcing Netdata Meetups: Virtual How-to Live Show – Join us Friday, March 4th

[Join us live this Friday!](https://youtu.be/lBd0-TFJGAY) We are launching the brand new Netdata Meetups! Join us to learn more about Netdata. This how-to virtual series will help you go deeper with Netdata and as a bonus we will add in tips and tricks for monitoring and troubleshooting. We can’t wait to see you on Friday, March 4th at 9 am PST (GMT -8).

## You are Invited!

In our first Netdata Meetup (<a href="https://youtu.be/lBd0-TFJGAY">watch live here this Friday</a>), Thiago Marques will present and show you how to install Netdata from scratch on a specific host and demonstrate how to understand navigating through the many, in-depth Netdata dashboards. Thiago will also cover understanding metric distribution. Monitoring is not only to visualize collected data, which is why we will show where host notifications are, and how to access A.I. to simplify even more the correlation between issues and hardware/software.

<strong>Bonus Learning Included!</strong> As a bonus, Thiago will present and teach about how processes see memory on a host.
